App Idea: Greatea Supply & Inventory Manager
I want to build an inventory management app specifically for Greatea's bubble tea business to track supply flow, manage stock levels, and ensure efficient restocking. This app would help keep an accurate record of daily supply usage, automatically notify staff of low-stock items, and generate a list of items to restock for the next day. It will be mobile-friendly, ensuring easy input at the end of the day.

## Notes

While building the CodePath iOS101 Prework app, I faced challenges with recording the demo video, setting up GitHub, and adapting to Xcode as a new environment. Learning GitHub workflows and navigating Xcode took time, but I gradually became familiar with them. These challenges helped me improve my version control, debugging, and iOS development skills. ðŸš€
